Why does this blog exist? Who would start *a blog* in 2022? I haven't read or followed one in years, I honestly don't know if anybody still does. Yet here I am, typing this first post.

To be fair, I'm really not doing this for anybody but myself. I haven't properly written down a coherent text in over 15 years by now and have never done so in English. Outside of school essays that is. So I guess I'm just looking for some way to put whatever is going on in my brain into words.

Where to begin then? The reason I even have this time is because of a six months sabbatical that is at the end of its first month now. I already have the feeling that I'm wasting this precious time off from work but in reality I think it's been going quite well so far. I had a major surgery which took up the first two weeks, relaxed for about a week afterwards and have now been making concrete travel plans for the rest of my time off.

Which is the whole reason for this blog to exist. Last week I had somewhat of an epiphany in regard to what I want to do. I remembered the existence of interrailing and immediately was hooked on the idea. I started plotting out possible routes and made a list of places I always wanted to visit. To avoid just taking some pictures along the way and 'forgetting' about the trip, I thought writing down my experiences and feelings throughout my travels would be helpful for me to reflect upon it.

Why interrailing though? I wasn't sure at first why the thought of travelling by train through Europe was so enticing for me. After mulling over it for a while I realised that interrailing was just the perfect mix of my comfort zone and seeking discomfort. I'm perfectly fine with travelling by train to the big cities of Europe and have done so on my own in the past. What will be different this time is that I plan to stay exclusively in hostels. I should probably mention here that I no longer am what you would call the 'target audience' for hostels. I turned 34 this year, and I'm getting close to the age limit some (very few) hostels have. I have never stayed in hostels outside of school trips when I was 16 or younger and have never been backpacking before. So there's plenty of new experiences to make that a lot of people make when they are way younger. But most people never make them at all, so I'd rather make them late than never.

In general, my personal timeline has always been skewed from 'the norm'. I behaved like a 30-year-old while I was still in school, started to work as a graphic designer right after instead of going to university like all of my friends. Then at the age of 25 I decided now would be the last chance I would have at going to university to not do the same boring job for the rest of my life. I started studying physics and got my Bachelor's degree in theoretical physics only for me to run out of money and into health problems when it came to me finishing my Master's degree. I went back to my old job to pay off some debts and finally started a new position as a front end web developer. I have been programming in all kinds of languages and frameworks since I was 13. Now, 19 years later, I finally was doing it as a job.

Anyway, after going off on that tangent, the reason for this blog to exist: I just felt like it. I want to write down what goes through my mind, so I can actually be mindful about the things I experience. Why do I not just keep a personal journal? I actually do carry around a small planner with me everywhere to scribble down some quick notes, but truth be told I'm learning ReactJS right now and used this blog as an excuse for another project to work on.

So, yeah, that's about it. You can tell that I have no idea how to structure a text with a proper conclusion, so I'm just going to leave it at this and thank anyone who actually read through these ramblings for being here.

Much love,

*Ben*
